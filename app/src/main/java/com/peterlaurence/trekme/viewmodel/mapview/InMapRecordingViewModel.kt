/**
 * This view-model backs the feature that enables a fragment to be aware of a recording
 * (e.g a list of [TrackPoint]) potentially launched way before **and** to be aware of new recording
 * points as they arrive. The use case is for example:
 * 1- User opens one map (MapViewFragment)
 * 2- User launches a recording for the RecordingFragment.
 * 3- The "live route" starts drawing on the screen (MapViewFragment)
 * 4- For some reason the user leaves the MapViewFragment or even closes the app (without stopping
 *    the recording)
 * 5- User returns to his map and expects to see his "live route" still there.
 *
 * Actually it should work for any map: the "live route" can be drawn for any map while a recording
 * is running.
 *
 * **Implementation**
 *
 * A producer-consumer pattern is employed here. The producer is the LocationService, the consumer
 * is a coroutine inside this view-model: [processNewTrackPoints]. Between the two, a [Channel]
 * serves as pipe and guaranties that no synchronisation issue will occur (despite the fact that
 * producer and the consumer work in two different threads).
 *
 * When this view-model first starts or upon request from the fragment (when the map changes), it
 * uses the event-bus to request the channel from the producer.
 * Upon reception of the channel, it launches its consumer coroutine ([processNewTrackPoints]).
 * The [MapProvider] is used to fetch the current map.
